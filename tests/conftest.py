"""
Point every test run at a fresh, isolated on-disk SQLite file — same
reasoning as nexus-financials-service's `tests/conftest.py` (see that
file's full docstring for why a real file, not `:memory:`):
`test_hr.py` and `test_hr_writes.py` each instantiate their own
`TestClient(app)`, each running on its own event loop, and an in-memory
SQLite DB is scoped to the single connection/loop that created it.

Must be set before any `app.*` module is imported — pytest loads every
`conftest.py` in a directory before collecting that directory's test
modules.
