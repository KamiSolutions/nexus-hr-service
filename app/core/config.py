Application configuration — nexus-hr-service.

JWT_SECRET_KEY here MUST equal nexus-identity-service's value: this service
verifies tokens statelessly (decode + scope check) rather than calling back
into identity-service per request. That's the whole point of a JWT-based
scheme in a polyrepo split — no synchronous auth-service round-trip on
every request. Keep the secret in lockstep via the shared secrets manager
(nexus-infra), never by copy-pasting .env files by hand.
