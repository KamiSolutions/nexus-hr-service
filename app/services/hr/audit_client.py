"""
Real audit-event emission to nexus-audit-service, authenticated with
the shared service-to-service credential, alongside every
state-changing write this service performs (create/update/delete an
employee) — same pattern established in
nexus-financials-service's `audit_client.py` for slice 1.

Honesty note: this service can't make its own DB write and the
downstream audit event land as one real cross-service transaction
without a saga/outbox pattern that doesn't exist yet (P1, same
limitation nexus-audit-service's own docstrings flag). So the domain
write below always succeeds or fails on its own merits, but the audit
event's own outcome is reported back honestly (`recorded` vs
`unavailable`, with the real reason) rather than assumed — the same
Operational/Attention Required honesty rule this project applies
everywhere else, applied here to one write's audit trail.
